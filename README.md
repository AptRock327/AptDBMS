# AptDBMS: A fast DBMS with basic SQL support

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a DataBase Management System written entirely from scratch in C. My goal was to deepen my understanding of B-trees, the structure underlying modern databases. The program features a basic SQL interpreter that allows the user to interact with a demo database with one table of students. Use basic SQL SEARCH and INSERT instructions to query the database, and enter 'exit' to exit. The software also comes with a function timer, and reaches relatively high performance results.
